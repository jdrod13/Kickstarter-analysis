# Kickstarting with Excel


## Overview of Project
    
    
   **Louise planed an event that came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Louise wants to understand better why some campaigns had a better success rate than other events that failed to reach the fundraising goal. We clean the data provided by Louise to show her what are the the main things that can be improved on her next fundraising event**




### Purpose
     
     
   **The purpose of this work is to clean and organize the data obtained from the fundraising event's results to make a successful report that demonstrates our findings based on their launch dates and goals.**




## Analysis and Challenges
  
  
  ### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
      
      
   **The first action on this analysis was making sure that all the data was formatted adequately without any errors. Second, to populate the proper Pivot table, it was necessary to transform the starting launch date of the event and the closing date from integers to actual year by using the proper function formula. Third, after finishing up finding the years, we realized that de data could be easier to use; therefore, we separated the "Parent Category and Subcategory "to separate columns with their own data displayed more clearly be used for our report. Then, we selected the outcomes column to filter it with successful, failed, and canceled events; after we selected parent category filter by "theater" and filtering our pivot table by months, then we added a line chart to have a better descriptive representation of our findings.**

 ### Analysis of Outcomes-based on Goals
    
    
   **We added a new numerical range criteria of numbers that were applied with the COUNTIFS fuction based on the goals and outcomes categories that work as part of our criteria combined with a new set of columns that represented the Number of successful, Number of failed, Number of canceled, the Total Number of projects, and their total percentages.**

 ### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
   
   
   
   **One of the challenges was converting the event's starting date and closing date data from an integer number to an actual date. Most importantly, making sure that our data was clean is especially important; otherwise, it could impact findings. By contrast, the biggest challenge was creating new ranges of information that met the expected results.**




## Results
       
       
       
   **As a result, the line chart gives us an accurate representation of our highest successful theater event between May and June with a quantity of 111-100 successful events, and the lowest amount of successful theater events was in December with 37. The line graph also represents the relationship between successful, failed, and canceled events over different months. On the other hand, from the Outcome-based on goal-line chart, we got results based on the criteria selected for this particular that demonstrates that the percentage failed from the outcomes based on goal dominated over the portion of successful events.**


-	What are the conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes-based on the Launch Date?



**This report is a detailed representation that demonstrates the higher success rate of theater events that met the goal compared to the number of failed and canceled theater events that did not meet the fundraising goal criteria.**

-	What are some limitations of this dataset?



**The data is not clean enough and has some irregularities.**



-	What are some other possible tables and graphs that we could create?



**many possible charts could have been studied, such as pivot tables based on different Parent categories and subcategories representing the results over victorious, failed, and canceled events based on outcomes launch date or goals many other options.**
